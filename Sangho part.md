# 2. Theoretical background
## Section 1. Coordinates
$\quad$ Understanding the Earth Centered Inertial Coordinates (ECI), Body Fixed Coordinates (BFC), and Wind Coordinates (WC) is crucial for deriving equations that describe the aerodynamics of aircraft flight. Precise comprehension of these coordinate systems enables the mathematical modeling of the physical forces acting upon an aircraft, facilitating an accurate prediction of its motion within each respective coordinate framework. The following provides an explanation of each coordinate system utilized in describing aircraft flight dynamics.

### 1. Wind Coordinates  
$\quad$ The wind coordinate system is utilized to represent aerodynamic forces significantly impacting an aircraft's motion. Its starting point is aerodynamic center (which is expressing aerodynamic force of aircraft), with the 𝑋-axis oriented along the direction of the wind. Following the right-hand rule, the 𝑌-axis is perpendicular to the 𝑋-axis, pointing towards the right wing, while the 𝑍-axis is defined as perpendicular to the 𝑋𝑌 plane, pointing downwards from the aircraft. With respect to the aircraft's body-fixed coordinate system, the rotation around the 𝑌-axis with respect to the wind direction is the Angle of Attack, and the rotation around the 𝑍-axis is the Side Slip Angle. The following equations represent the Angle of Attack and Side Slip Angle, accompanied by a diagram illustrating the wind coordinate system.

## Section 3. Bezier Curve

$\quad$ "A Bézier Curve" is a mathematical curve defined using polynomial functions. Generally, an $𝑛$-th degree Bézier curve is defined by $𝑛+1$ control points. Widely employed in graphic design and computer graphics, Bézier curves are primarily used to create smooth and intricate curves by manipulating control points.

## Section 4. Target Aircraft

The KP-2C features a box-wing configuration, with a total of four propellers, two ailerons, and two V-shaped tail wings. During vertical takeoff, it generates thrust in the vertical direction using all four propellers, enabling it to rotate like a conventional helicopter. In cruise mode, it transitions by horizontally tilting the front two propellers while keeping the rear two propellers inactive, resembling the flight of a fixed-wing aircraft. During transition flight, all four propellers and control surfaces are utilized to control attitude and speed, with adjustments to the tilt angle of the front propellers. Below are the specifications and configuration of the KP-2C.

# 3. Transition Flight Schedule

## Section 1. Transition Flight Scheduling

$\quad$ Transition flight scheduling begins with speed scheduling and is derived through lift distribution load factor scheduling and trim analysis. The figure below illustrates the entire transition flight scheduling process.

<center>

!["Trans Process"](/final%20image/image%208.jpeg)

< Picture 8 > Transition Flight Scheduling Process

</center>

<br>
<p align="center"> 16

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Speed Schedule
$\quad$ In the transition flight process, the aircraft must accelerate from a stationary state to the target speed. The rate of speed change in this process influence the rate of acceleration, and the magnitude of such changes affects the aircraft's flight performance or required performance. If the speed change during the transition flight process is too rapid, it demands a significant acceleration, while if it is too slow, reaching the target speed within the given time may be unattainable. Additionally, if the speed change is not smooth at the beginning and end of the transition flight, abrupt acceleration or deceleration may occur, and stable settling to the target speed becomes challenging because acceleration persists after the end moment. Therefore, speed scheduling should be designed to ensure that the acceleration is zero at the start and end points and that the acceleration is not excessively high in between.

### 2. Lift distribution load factor (Load factor)
$\quad$ Lift distribution load factor refers to the ratio of forces in the vertical (𝑍-axis) direction between the lift generated by the wings and the thrust generated by the propellers in the body-fixed coordinate system. Typically, VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft have a higher thrust-dominant load factor at low speeds, while at high speeds, the lift from the wings dominates. These variations have a significant impact during transition flight segments where the flight speed undergoes significant changes. Therefore, inducing a smooth change in the lift distribution load factor is crucial for ensuring stability.

$\quad$ During transition flight segments, the load factor can vary significantly depending on the aircraft's attitude. To avoid affecting flight stability, it is necessary to maintain the attitude from the pre-stalling angle and target a load factor of 1 (where lift equals weight) at the target speed.

<br>
<p align="center"> 17

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$\quad$ For the target eVTOL Tiltrotor aircraft, it is essential to set the attitude between the stalling angle and the level state at 0 degrees in such a way that the lift distribution load factor becomes 1 at the target speed. By maintaining a high Angle of Attack, lift can equal weight at relatively low speeds, while keeping a Low Angle of Attack can achieve the same at higher speeds. The lift distribution load factor diagram is determined differently based on the aircraft's performance. The following is a general lift distribution load factor diagram.

<center>

!["load factor"](/final%20image/image%209.jpeg)

< Picture 9 > Lift distribution load factor

</center>

$\quad$ The lift distribution load factor for the wing as a function of flight speed satisfies the equation below. Through numerical analysis techniques using lift distribution load factor, one can derive the flight angle of attack at the corresponding speed. By utilizing the previously planned speed schedule and the designed lift distribution load factor for the wing, it is possible to obtain the flight pitch angle schedule and the rate of change of flight pitch angle schedule.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Aircraft Modeling

$\quad$ The physical forces acting on the aircraft include lift, thrust, and gravity. Lift is the force generated by the wings, acting at the center of lift, which is the origin in the wind coordinate system. Thrust is generated by each propeller and acts at the center of each propeller. Gravity acts at the center of gravity. In the case of transition flight, the tilt angle of the propellers changes, significantly affecting the longitudinal dynamics. Therefore, in this paper, only the longitudinal factors that have a significant impact on transition flight are considered to reduce complexity.

$\quad$ In the case of lift modeling, element-based modeling was employed to model the wing and tail control surfaces, which influence the lift coefficients. Using the situation where the angle of the tail control surface is 0 degrees as a reference, the lift coefficient static term, which changes with the wing's flight pitch angle, was modeled. Using this as a reference, the lift coefficient control term, which changes with the angle of the tail control surface at the corresponding flight pitch angle, was modeled. Additionally, coefficient variations caused by changes in angular velocity were ignored since the aircraft's attitude changes were not significant. The following are the modeled equations for lift, drag, and pitching moment.

$\quad$ The forces and moments generated by the lift coefficients mentioned above can be expressed taking into account atmospheric density and flight speed as follows:

<br>
<p align="center"> 19

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$\quad$ For the thrust, modeling was based on wind tunnel tests of the aircraft's propellers to consider the maximum performance while accounting for performance limits. During the trim analysis process, the thrust is derived as the required thrust, requiring only information on the maximum performance to consider physical constraints. The wind tunnel tests were conducted in the Konkuk University low-speed wind tunnel, using the actual unmanned aircraft's electric propulsion system. The tests varied the propeller inflow velocity to consider the performance changes with varying propeller inflow velocities. Below are photos of the wind tunnel test equipment and the results.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$\quad$ The thrust performance data corresponding to changes in propeller inflow velocity is shown in the following pictures. The tests were conducted by varying the propeller inflow velocity in 5 $m/s$ intervals from 0 $m/s$ to 20 $m/s$.

</center>

$\quad$ According to the wind tunnel test results, it is observed that the rotational speed and thrust increase with throttle input. Additionally, concerning the variation in propeller inflow velocity, it is noted that the maximum thrust decreases as the propeller inflow velocity increases. To account for the decrease in maximum thrust, a third-degree polynomial interpolation was performed to predict the performance changes within the unmeasured range. Below is the result picture using the third-degree polynomial interpolation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Trim analysis
$\quad$ To derive the transition flight schedule, trim analysis was performed to obtain control inputs that satisfy the trim conditions over time, including pitch attitude, angular velocities, flight speed, and acceleration. The purpose of trim analysis is to determine control values that satisfy the given flight state, confirming the feasibility of flight under the interpreted conditions. For this, an aircraft model is necessary, including propulsion, lift, and other physical force models.

$\quad$ According to the trim analysis conditions, the forces and moments in the Earth-centered coordinate system must satisfy the given flight state. In this context, the force in the X-axis direction of the Earth-centered coordinate system in the modeled aircraft must be equal to the product of X-axis acceleration and mass at the corresponding flight speed. Similarly, the force in the Z-axis direction must be equal to the product of Z-axis acceleration and mass at the given flight speed. The Y-axis moment should be equal to the product of inertia moment and angular velocity. The following represents the trim analysis equations.

<center>

</center>

<br>
<p align="center"> 23

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

$\quad$ In trim analysis, the given control elements are the thrust from the front propeller, thrust from the rear propeller, tail control surface angle, and propeller tilt angle. There are a total of four variables to be solved for three equations, resulting in an over-constrained system. To address this, one of the variables, the propeller tilt angle, was assigned a value, and the analysis was performed by solving the three remaining equations with three variables.Unlike conventional aircraft where the thrust components are not distinguished between front and rear, the Tiltrotor's specific configuration introduces additional variables. 

$\quad$ Trim analysis is carried out under given conditions of flight speed, acceleration, angular velocity, and propeller tilt angle, determining the required thrust to satisfy the trim conditions by analyzing the force in the Z-axis direction and the moment in the Y-axis direction in the Earth-centered inertial coordinate system. The following matrix equation represents the balance of forces and moments in the Z and Y directions in the Earth-centered inertial coordinate system to obtain the required thrust.

</center>

<br>
<p align="center"> 24

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

$\quad$ Subsequently, employing numerical methods, the trim condition-satisfying tail control surface angle is determined from the force equation in the X-axis direction. This process is iteratively conducted to obtain the required thrust and control surface angles satisfying the trim conditions for all three axes. By performing these iterations for various propeller tilt angles, the range of propeller tilt angles that satisfy the trim conditions is identified. The magnitude of the required thrust varies with the propeller tilt angle. In this paper, a propeller tilt schedule is determined by selecting the required thrust as the objective function and finding the propeller tilt angle that minimizes the required thrust. The following diagram illustrates the Tiltrotor trim analysis process.

## Section 2. Transition Flight Schedule for the Target Aircraft
$\quad$ Based on the previous information, the transition flight schedule for the target aircraft was derived. The transition flight schedule was developed for two designed lift distribution schedules. The target time and target speed for the transition flight schedule were set. The target time utilized the default setting time of 7 seconds for the transition flight algorithm in the flight control software, for future comparison and analysis. The target speed was set to allow a 20% margin from the stall speed. The stall speed is the speed at which the lift generated equals the weight of the aircraft, occurring at the maximum lift coefficient. The following are the formulas for calculating the stall speed, target speed, and the aircraft's lift coefficient graph.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. The speed schedule for the target aircraft
$\quad$ The speed schedule for the target aircraft is designed for two cases, denoted as 𝐴 and 𝐵. The speed schedule utilizes a 3rd-degree Bezier curve to ensure that the acceleration is zero at start and end points. In the first case 𝐴, the design involves smoothly accelerating and decelerating, using a 3rd-degree Bezier curve with four control points. The starting and ending points are fixed, and the two middle control points are adjusted. These two control points are positioned at 20% and 80% of the total time duration. Below are the control points and the resulting speed schedule obtained from the 3rd-degree Bezier curve.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$\quad$ The second case, 𝐵, is designed to accelerate slowly and then decelerate rapidly near the end. For the 3rd-degree Bezier curve, the starting and ending points are fixed, and the two middle control points are adjusted. These middle control points are positioned at 60% and 80% of the total time duration. The following are the control point details for the 3rd-degree Bezier curve and the resulting speed schedule. Additionally, comparison graphs depicting the variation in jerk, acceleration, speed, and distance for both speed schedules are provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2. Lift Distribution of the Target Aircraft
$\quad$ Based on the designed aircraft speed schedule, the aircraft's angle of attack schedule was derived through the lift distribution chart. Here, as the lift distribution changes, the angle of attack schedule of the aircraft also changes. To analyze the influence of the lift distribution chart, two different lift distribution charts were designed.

$\quad$ The first lift distribution chart maintains a constant angle of attack during the transition flight process to ensure that the wing's lift distribution reaches 1 at the target speed. The second lift distribution chart also reaches 1 at the target speed, but for a smoother change in lift distribution, the slope of the wing's lift distribution with respect to speed is designed to be 0 at the target speed using a Bezier curve.

$\quad$ The first lift distribution chart is expressed as a constant angle of attack, denoted as 'Constant', and the second lift distribution chart varies the angle of attack, denoted as 'Change'. The following are the designed lift distribution charts and the resulting schedules for angle of attack and angle of attack rate over time.

### 3. Trim analysis of the Target aircraft
$\quad$ Utilizing the previously derived aircraft motion schedule, a trim analysis was conducted. In the trim analysis process, the propeller tilt angle that minimizes the total required thrust of the aircraft was determined, with the goal of maintaining a constant altitude. For this reason, the trim analysis focused on the longitudinal direction, and the aircraft motion schedule considered the elements in the 𝑋-axis direction in the Earth-centered inertial coordinate system. Additionally, it was assumed that the pitch attitude angle and angle of attack during flight were the same. The following are the results obtained through the trim analysis method described earlier.

<br>
<p align="center"> 32

!["Tirm Analysis"](/final%20image/image%2023.jpeg)

< Picture 23 > The transitional flight schedule of the target aircraft

</center>

<br>
<p align="center"> 33

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$\quad$ According to the transitional flight schedule derived from the trim analysis, it is commonly observed that as the flight speed of the target aircraft increases, the front thrust gradually increases while the rear thrust decreases, reaching zero at a specific time. Additionally, with the change in pitch attitude, there is a slight variation, but consistently, an initially negative pitching moment is generated, followed by a positive pitching moment produced using the tail control surface.

$\quad$ Regarding the flight angle of attack, a larger angle of attack results in an increased difference in the magnitude of front and rear thrust. When an increased flight angle of attack is required, it is noted that a smaller front propeller tilt angle leads to a larger front thrust compared to the rear thrust.

$\quad$ These results can be interpreted based on the aircraft's configuration and flight characteristics. The target aircraft has the thrust center of the propeller positioned above the aircraft's center of gravity. Therefore, as the front propeller tilt angle decreases, the influence of the pitching moment generated by the front thrust diminishes, resulting in a transition from positive to negative pitching moment. This change in the direction of the thrust-induced pitching moment highlights the active use of the tail control surface for pitch control. Similarly, the reduction in the need for rear propeller thrust is observed as the tail control surface generates a positive pitching moment that counteracts the negative pitching moment produced by the front propeller thrust.
