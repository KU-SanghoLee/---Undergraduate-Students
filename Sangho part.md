## 2.1 Coordinates
Understanding the Earth Centered Inertial Coordinates (ECI), Body Fixed Coordinates (BFC), and Wind Coordinates (WC) is crucial for deriving equations that describe the aerodynamics of aircraft flight. Precise comprehension of these coordinate systems enables the mathematical modeling of the physical forces acting upon an aircraft, facilitating an accurate prediction of its motion within each respective coordinate framework. The following provides an explanation of each coordinate system utilized in describing aircraft flight dynamics.

- Wind Coordinates  
The wind coordinate system is utilized to represent aerodynamic forces significantly impacting an aircraft's motion. Its starting point is aerodynamic center (which is expressing aerodynamic force of aircraft), with the 𝑋-axis oriented along the direction of the wind. Following the right-hand rule, the 𝑌-axis is perpendicular to the 𝑋-axis, pointing towards the right wing, while the 𝑍-axis is defined as perpendicular to the 𝑋𝑌 plane, pointing downwards from the aircraft. With respect to the aircraft's body-fixed coordinate system, the rotation around the 𝑌-axis with respect to the wind direction is the Angle of Attack, and the rotation around the 𝑍-axis is the Side Slip Angle. The following equations represent the Angle of Attack and Side Slip Angle, accompanied by a diagram illustrating the wind coordinate system.
