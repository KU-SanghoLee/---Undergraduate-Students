# 4. Establishing an eVTOL Tiltrotor Flight Simulation Environment

## Section 1. Electric Propulsion Model (KFDS)
$\quad$ The target aircraft is an eVTOL Tiltrotor aircraft that uses an electric propulsion system. Through flight simulation, an electric propulsion model was added to JSBSim, an open source based flight dynamics software, to predict the flight state of the aircraft. The electric propulsion system of the target aircraft consists of a battery, a power distribution board (PDB), an electronic speed controller (ESC), a blushless direct current (BLDC) motor, and a propeller. The power distribution board does not require any special modeling because it serves to distribute the power required by each component. Therefore, the 
remaining components except the power distribution board were modeled. The figure below is the architecture of the electric propulsion model.

### 1. Battery Model
$\quad$ Batteries store electrical energy and provide electricity to the aircraft during flight. The type and capacity of the battery greatly affects the flight time and performance of the aircraft, and the target aircraft uses a lithium polymer (Li-Po) battery. Lithium polymer batteries are lightweight and have high energy density. They are widely used in various electronic devices and mobile devices, and are also widely used in unmanned aerial vehicles. These lithium polymer batteries can store high energy per unit weight at high energy density and can store energy for a long period of time at a low discharge rate. In addition, since it can handle high discharge current, it can cope with sudden power changes during flight, maintain high voltage, and have relatively light weight. The lithium polymer battery model tables the voltage performance that varies depending on the amount of charge, and models the capacity used to drive other components. The equation below is a voltage model provided by the battery as ESC.

$U_{Battery_{out}} = U_{Battery} - I_{Battery} \cdot R_{Battery}$

### 2. ESC Model
$\quad$ The ESC electronically controls the speed of the BLDC motor and transmits the power of the motor. It controls the thrust and torque generated by precisely controlling the rotational speed of the motor and supports the efficient operation of the motor. In addition to controlling the rotational speed of the motor through ESC, it also functions to protect the motor from overheating, overcurrent, short circuit, etc., monitors the voltage of the battery, and protects the battery from discharging. The ESC operates through the reception of the PWM signal, controls the voltage applied to the motor in the internal circuit in accordance with the PWM signal, and controls the rotation of the motor. ESC, used together with BLDC motors, is widely used in unmanned aerial vehicles. The equation below is a voltage model provided by ESC to BLDC motor.

$U_{ESC} = \delta_{throttle} \cdot R_{Battery} - I_{ESC} \cdot R_{ESC}$

### 3. BLDC Motor Model
$\quad$ The BLDC motor generates rotational motion and rotates the propeller to generate thrust and torque. Since there is no brush, it has the characteristic of operating efficiently without friction and energy loss of the brush, and each motor provides performance in specific flight conditions. It provides excellent performance in high speed and high power applications, and can achieve a higher number of rotations than a brush motor. In addition, there is no external physical contact due to rotation using a magnetic force, and accurate control is possible through an electronic control device. This feature is used in various fields such as unmanned aerial vehicles, electric bicycles, robots, and industrial automation. The equation below is the torque generated by the BLDC motor, the power provided by the propeller, and the current model required by the ESC.

<center>

$Q_{Motor}$ = $K_{t} \cdot (I_{Motor_{required}} - I_{Motor_{idle}}$)

$P_{Motor}$ = $Q_{Motor} \cdot \Omega_{propeller}$

$I_{Motor_{required}} = \frac {U_{ESC} - RPM/ K_{v}} {R_{Motor}}$
