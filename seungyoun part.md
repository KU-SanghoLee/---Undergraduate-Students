# 4. Establishing an eVTOL Tiltrotor Flight Simulation Environment

## Section 1. Electric Propulsion Model (KFDS)
$\quad$ The target aircraft is an eVTOL Tiltrotor aircraft that uses an electric propulsion system. Through flight simulation, an electric propulsion model was added to JSBSim, an open source based flight dynamics software, to predict the flight state of the aircraft. The electric propulsion system of the target aircraft consists of a battery, a power distribution board (PDB), an electronic speed controller (ESC), a blushless direct current (BLDC) motor, and a propeller. The power distribution board does not require any special modeling because it serves to distribute the power required by each component. Therefore, the 
remaining components except the power distribution board were modeled. The figure below is the architecture of the electric propulsion model.

### 1. Battery Model
$\quad$ Batteries store electrical energy and provide electricity to the aircraft during flight. The type and capacity of the battery greatly affects the flight time and performance of the aircraft, and the target aircraft uses a lithium polymer (Li-Po) battery. Lithium polymer batteries are lightweight and have high energy density. They are widely used in various electronic devices and mobile devices, and are also widely used in unmanned aerial vehicles. These lithium polymer batteries can store high energy per unit weight at high energy density and can store energy for a long period of time at a low discharge rate. In addition, since it can handle high discharge current, it can cope with sudden power changes during flight, maintain high voltage, and have relatively light weight. The lithium polymer battery model tables the voltage performance that varies depending on the amount of charge, and models the capacity used to drive other components. The equation below is a voltage model provided by the battery as ESC.

<center>

$U_{Battery_{out}} = U_{Battery} - I_{Battery} \cdot R_{Battery}$

</center>

### 2. ESC Model
$\quad$ The ESC electronically controls the speed of the BLDC motor and transmits the power of the motor. It controls the thrust and torque generated by precisely controlling the rotational speed of the motor and supports the efficient operation of the motor. In addition to controlling the rotational speed of the motor through ESC, it also functions to protect the motor from overheating, overcurrent, short circuit, etc., monitors the voltage of the battery, and protects the battery from discharging. The ESC operates through the reception of the PWM signal, controls the voltage applied to the motor in the internal circuit in accordance with the PWM signal, and controls the rotation of the motor. ESC, used together with BLDC motors, is widely used in unmanned aerial vehicles. The equation below is a voltage model provided by ESC to BLDC motor.

<center>

$U_{ESC} = \delta_{throttle} \cdot R_{Battery} - I_{ESC} \cdot R_{ESC}$

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3. BLDC Motor Model
$\quad$ The BLDC motor generates rotational motion and rotates the propeller to generate thrust and torque. Since there is no brush, it has the characteristic of operating efficiently without friction and energy loss of the brush, and each motor provides performance in specific flight conditions. It provides excellent performance in high speed and high power applications, and can achieve a higher number of rotations than a brush motor. In addition, there is no external physical contact due to rotation using a magnetic force, and accurate control is possible through an electronic control device. This feature is used in various fields such as unmanned aerial vehicles, electric bicycles, robots, and industrial automation. The equation below is the torque generated by the BLDC motor, the power provided by the propeller, and the current model required by the ESC.

<center>

$Q_{Motor}$ = $K_{t} \cdot (I_{Motor_{required}} - I_{Motor_{idle}}$)

$P_{Motor}$ = $Q_{Motor} \cdot \Omega_{propeller}$

$I_{Motor_{required}} = \frac {U_{ESC} - RPM/ K_{v}} {R_{Motor}}$

</center>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4. Propeller Model
$\quad$ The propeller generates the thrust and torque of the aircraft through the aerodynamic force in the propeller by the rotational motion generated by the BLDC motor. The performance varies depending on the length, the shape of the propeller cross-section airfoil, the twist, and the pitch angle. The moment of inertia, diameter, the number of blades, and the geometric pitch angle of the propeller were considered, and in order to consider the performance of the propeller that changes according to the forward speed of the aircraft, it was modeled as the thrust and power coefficient according to the forward ratio. The equation below is a model for thrust, power, forward ratio, propeller efficiency, and rotation speed.

<center>

$T$ = $C_{thrust} \rho n^2 D_{prop}^4$

$P$ = $C_{power} \rho n^3 D_{prop}^5$

$J$ = $\frac {V_{inflow}}{nD}$

$\eta$ = $\frac {C_{thrust}V_{inflow}}{C_{power}nD}$

$RPM=RPS + \frac {60(P_{Motor}-P_{required})}{2I_{{xx}_{prop}} \cdot \Omega_{propeller}} \cdot \pi$

## Section 2. Model Database
$\quad$ A database used in aircraft models is needed to predict the condition of the aircraft. The database can express the forces and moments acting on the aircraft. The model database of aircraft is largely divided into shape, weight and balance, aerodynamic, and propulsion.

### 1. Shape Database
$\quad$ The aircraft shape database contains shape information such as the main blade area, length, cord length, and the origin of the wind coordinate system. The origin of the wind coordinate system is defined as AeroRP, and if the aerodynamic force is the position acting on the model and does not exactly match the center of gravity, an additional moment or torsional force is generated. Other aircraft models are not affected, but there are tail control planes and position information due to various needs. The tail control plane information is used by the JSBSim Turbulence code and does not affect the actual flight dynamics model. EYEPOINT is the point at which the pilot's point-in-time position is calculated, and the gravitational acceleration felt by the pilot during flight is calculated. VRP is the origin of the world position in an aircraft. The following is the aircraft shape database information.

### 2. Weight and Inertia Database
$\quad$ The weight and inertia database contains information on the physical properties caused by aircraft mass. The moment of inertia creates a slower rotational force than the low value where the high value is not, and the $I_{XZ}$, $I_{YZ}$, and $I_{XY}$ terms are generally zero because the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ axes are the main axes. However, in the case of an asymmetric aircraft shape, a term may exist because the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ axes do not match the symmetrical axis of the aircraft. In the case of weight, it represents the empty weight of the aircraft, but in this paper, the weight of each element is considered as 0, and the total weight is represented by generating weight and inertia data for the whole during the analysis process. Therefore, the weight and inertia database shows information for the entire aircraft. The center of gravity represents the origin of the fuselage fixed coordinate system and is the point of action of gravity. The following is information on the weight and inertia database.

### 3. Electric Propulsion System Database
$\quad$ In the case of the propulsion system database, it contains information on the position and performance of the electric propulsion system of the eVTOL drone. The electric propulsion system of the eVTOL drone consists of a battery, an ESC, an electric motor, and a propeller. In the case of position, it represents the position of the electric motor connected to the propeller as the point of action of the thrust. The position database is as follows.

$\quad$ Torque generated by the electric motor rotates the propeller to generate the thrust and torque acting on the aircraft. The propeller used the XOAR-15x7 product, and a database considering the forward ratio was used as table-type data for the thrust and power coefficients. The propeller database contains the propeller's moment of inertia, diameter, and number of blades, and includes information on the geometric minimum and maximum pitch angle of the blade. The thrust and power coefficients are in the form of a table, according to the minimum rotational speed and the forward ratio representing the performance of the propeller. The independent variables of the two tables are the forward ratio, and the dependent variables are the thrust and power coefficients. In the case of a variable pitch propeller, a two-dimensional table can be used to represent the thrust and power coefficients according to the forward ratio and pitch angle. The following is an equation and database for thrust and power.
